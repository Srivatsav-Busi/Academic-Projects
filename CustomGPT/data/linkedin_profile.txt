ABOUT
Seven years of hands-on experience in AI/ML, data engineering, and process improvement. Currently working as ML Engineer at Yahoo, with expertise in building end-to-end ML pipelines, data processing, and cloud-based solutions. Passionate about leveraging machine learning and data technologies to solve complex business challenges.

Currently designing and optimizing ML pipelines using Kubeflow Pipelines at Yahoo. Previously built secure data processing workflows at Experian and worked on cloud-based ML solutions at various organizations.

Core expertise includes:
• End-to-end ML pipeline development with Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)
• Data processing and ETL with Apache Spark, Airflow, and cloud services
• Cloud platforms: GCP (BigQuery, Vertex AI, Dataflow), AWS (Lambda, EMR, Step Functions), Azure
• Programming: Python, R, SQL, PySpark, Shell Scripting
• Data security and encryption workflows for sensitive data processing

EXPERIENCE

ML Engineer at Yahoo
Mar 2024 - Present (8 months)
San Francisco, CA

• Designed, developed, and optimized end-to-end ML pipelines using KFP (Kubeflow Pipelines), incorporating lightweight components for training, evaluation, and model promotion workflows
• Developed modular and reusable lightweight components for tasks like data ingestion, TFRecord processing, and model evaluation, ensuring seamless integration into existing pipelines
• Implemented automated artifact promotion workflows, gating releases based on evaluation pipeline results, ensuring consistent quality across Dev, PPD, and PRD environments
• Developed and optimized automated data pipelines to load diverse file formats (TFRecord, Parquet, CSV, JSON) from Google Cloud Storage into BigQuery
• Leveraged Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, including BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Vertex AI, to build scalable, cost-effective machine learning solutions
• Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including data scientists, DevOps engineers, and product managers, while mentoring junior team members

Data Engineer Intern at Insight Global
Aug 2023 - Dec 2023 (5 months)
Atlanta, GA

• Developed and implemented high-performance relational databases, ensuring data integrity and optimal performance through adherence to normalization principles
• Leveraged Neo4j's graph database capabilities to develop efficient route selection algorithms, optimizing delivery times and costs for complex logistics networks
• Harnessed Azure Data Factory to orchestrate seamless data transfers from on-premises to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Senior Data Engineer at Experian
Jan 2018 - Dec 2022 (5 years)
Hyderabad, India

• Built end-to-end decryption workflows using AWS Step Functions, Lambda, S3, and EMR, automating secure file ingestion and processing for datasets
• Engineered Lambda-based preprocessors to parse manifests and remove PGP trailers, ensuring downstream readiness and accurate record validation in AWS-based ETL flows
• Used Amazon EMR to process encrypted batches and emit marker files upon successful decryption, enabling event-driven orchestration with downstream services
• Created validation checks in AWS Step Functions and Lambda to match decrypted record counts against manifests, minimizing SLA breaches and pipeline failures
• Parsed Docker image scan outputs using Python on Lambda, autogenerated secure RUN apt upgrade scripts, and integrated patch logic into CI/CD pipelines
• Tuned Lambda memory/time configurations and parallelized steps in AWS Step Functions, reducing latency for decryption workloads across multiple cloud vendors

Data Engineer at Waste Management
